#ScriptEase II
ScriptEase II is a program that allows video game designers to add events to their games without directly knowing how to code software. Instead of a programming language, ScriptEase gives the user a graphical user interface to add functionality to their game worlds. ScriptEase II can work with any supported game through the use of specific translators.

ScriptEase II was the product of University of Alberta research before becoming an open source project in 2015.
