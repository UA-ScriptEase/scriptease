This is the mod file for our Hack-E-Bot 
examples. We don't save anything to this file
currently.

Square: Moves in a square pattern and turns 
randomly when it discovers an obstacle

Dance: Moves forward, back and does a spin. 
Also shows an example of adjusting one of the 
wheels so it will move at the same speed as the
other wheel. This may need to be removed or
changed for your own robot
